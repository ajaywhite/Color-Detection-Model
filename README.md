# Color Detection with OpenCV

## Description

This project demonstrates how to perform real-time color detection using OpenCV. The program captures video frames, converts them to the HSV color space, and detects predefined color segments. Each detected color is highlighted with a bounding box and a label.

## Features

- Real-time video processing and color detection.
- Configurable HSV ranges for detecting various colors.
- Bounding boxes and labels for visualizing detected colors.
- Simple and extensible code structure for adding more color segments.
